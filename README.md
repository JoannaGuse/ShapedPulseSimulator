# ShapedPulseSimulator 
ShapedPulseSimulator is a research tool for designing and simulating microwave pulses and pulse sequences for pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy. It provides functions for designing and optimixing The Ampliture and Frequence modulation of microwave pulses, or pulse sequences, with examples provided for common pulse sequences such as the Hahn echo and T1 inversion experiements. 

# Installation and getting started
To get started, simply download the package into your MATLAB folder, and add the full path to the ShapedPulseSimulator folder to the Matlab search path. 

Then, to get started, simply type 
 	Help ShapedPulseSimulator 
to get a list of functions and example usages. 

The GUI can be opened by running PulseDesignApplication().

Some common examples have been provided as a guide.
