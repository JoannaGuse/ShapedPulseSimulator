# ShapedPulseSimulator 
ShapedPulseSimulator is a research tool for designing and simulating microwave pulses and pulse sequences for pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy. It provides functions for designing and optimixing the Amplitude and Frequence modulation of microwave pulses, or pulse sequences, with examples provided for common pulse sequences such as the Hahn echo and T1 inversion experiements. 

Unlike many other such tools which ask the question "given this pulse sequence, simulate the quantum ensembe spin evolution", this package inverts the question
"given these experimental parameters, design a pulse/pulses to perform this quantum operation"

# Installation and getting started
To get started, simply download the package into your MATLAB folder, and add the full path to the ShapedPulseSimulator folder to the Matlab search path. 

Then, to get started, simply type 

 	Help ShapedPulseSimulator 
  
to get a list of functions and example usages. 

The GUI can be opened by running PulseDesignApplication().

Some common examples have been provided in the Examples folder.
