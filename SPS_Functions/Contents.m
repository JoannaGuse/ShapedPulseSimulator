%   Concatenate_BIR4             - Concatenates a pre-defined inversion (pi) pulse into a BIR4 pulse, with rotation angle
%   Concatenate_PhaseTime        - Concatenates a pre-defined pulse into a time-reversed+phase-reversed
%   Create_Optimized_Pulse       - This function generates an optimized pulse for a user-specified
%   Create_Pulse                 - This function generates a fully specified pulse. User must provide B1max,
